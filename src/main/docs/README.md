This is a java library that tries to parse and analyze the useragent string and extract as many relevant attributes as possible.

Blog post 
=========
A bit more background about this useragent parser can be found in this blog which I wrote about it: [https://techlab.bol.com/making-sense-user-agent-string/](https://partnerprogramma.bol.com/click/click?p=1&t=url&s=2171&f=TXL&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechlab.bol.com%2Fmaking-sense-user-agent-string%2F&name=yauaa)

Example output
==============
As an example the useragent of my phone:

    Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; Nexus 6 Build/NBD90Z) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.124 Mobile Safari/537.36

is converted into this set of fields:

| Field name | Value |

|  **Device**Class                      | 'Phone'                |

**NOTES**

1. This runs under a "Free quota" on Google AppEngine. If this quota is exceeded then it will simply become unavailable for that day.
2. After a while of inactivity the instance is terminated so the first page may take 15-30 seconds to load.
3. If you really like this then run it on your local systems. It's much faster that way.
